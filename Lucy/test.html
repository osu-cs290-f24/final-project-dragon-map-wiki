                                    <p>The Chinese Dragon also known as loong, is a legendary creature

                                        Chinese dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish,
                                        but are most commonly depicted as snake-like with four legs. 
                                        Academicians have identified four reliable theories on the origin of 
                                        the Chinese dragon: snakes, Chinese alligators, thunder worship and 
                                        nature worship. They traditionally symbolize
                                        potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water.

                                        The wyvern in its various forms is important in heraldry,

                                        (chiefly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada).

                                        and folklore. Today, it is often used in fantasy literature

                                       and folklore is rarely fire-breathing, unlike other dragons.

                                    <p>Medieval England
                                        English folklore portrays dragons as kidnapping maidens from castles, resulting in a battle with a hero. The hero then slays them and rescues the maiden.
                                        There is a good chance that people living in medieval England believed in dragons. This was obviously before the internet existed, so information spread through written chronicles and word of mouth. People believed that disease spread through poisoned air.
                                        Mainly affected were marshes, a habitat for dragons. One story features a dragon that terrorised Dunster in the Somerset levels, before it was banished by St Carantoc.
                                        The dragon was both terrifying and noble to people. Dragons feature on many coats of arms. This image of the dragon was commonly a 
                                        lizard-like, winged creature, breaking from earlier tradition.

                                    <p>Japanese dragons a are diverse legendary creatures in Japanese mythology and folklore. Japanese dragon
                                        myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons from China, Korea and the Indian subcontinent. 
                                        The style and appearance of the dragon was heavily influenced by the Chinese dragon, especially the three-clawed long 
                                        dragons which were introduced in Japan from China in ancient times.Like these other East Asian dragons,
                                        most Japanese ones are water deities or kami associated with rainfall
                                        and bodies of water, and are typically depicted as large, wingless, serpentine creatures with clawed feet. Like Ryujin the god of the sea
