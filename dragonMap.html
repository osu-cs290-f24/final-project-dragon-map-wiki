              <h3>Medieval England
                English folklore portrays dragons as kidnapping maidens from castles, resulting in a battle with a hero. The hero then slays them and rescues the maiden.
                There is a good chance that people living in medieval England believed in dragons. This was obviously before the internet existed, so information spread through written chronicles and word of mouth. People believed that disease spread through poisoned air.
                 Mainly affected were marshes, a habitat for dragons. One story features a dragon that terrorised Dunster in the Somerset levels, before it was banished by St Carantoc.
                The dragon was both terrifying and noble to people. Dragons feature on many coats of arms. This image of the dragon was commonly a 
                lizard-like, winged creature, breaking from earlier tradition.</h3>
